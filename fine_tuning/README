Fine-Tuning

## Distillation_FT
This folder includes standard fine-tuning for the Llama 3 Instruct model
- This is named "distillation" because the gold answers are generated from a teacher model, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- The small student model is trained to generate questions about videos based on structured inputs
- The gold answers are masked and the model is trained to predict the gold answers
- The model is evaluated with F1 and BERTScore metrics

## Masked Fine-Tuning
This folder includes our research-driven fine-tuning approach where we mask sections of the input associated with gold label questions and have the model predict
