I got you.

[00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:30.358] [Unknown]
Give your insurance card or anything like that.

[00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:30.798] [Unknown]
You're fine.

[00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:36.267] [Unknown]
We'll get this back to you.

[00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:39.292] [Unknown]
It's usually like this little square card about the size of a credit card.

[00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:39.713] [Unknown]
Okay, I got you one.

[00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:39.833] [Unknown]
Okay.

[00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:45.530] [Unknown]
Okay, no worries, if you can pull that insurance up, just something to show, is it a registered user or the visa?

[00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.670] [Unknown]
Okay.

[00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.030] [Unknown]
All right.

[00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.433] [Unknown]
The reason for the stop is going to be your speed.

[00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:49.934] [Unknown]
You're going to do how fast you're going?

[00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:52.337] [Unknown]
Yeah, I got you at 97.

[00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:08.212] [Unknown]
So what's your phone number?

[00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:08.993] [Unknown]
Perfect.

[00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:13.519] [Unknown]
What's up in Detroit?

[00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:16.923] [Unknown]
OK. OK. No worries.

[00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.005] [Unknown]
Just ask.

[00:02:19.407 --> 00:02:21.549] [Unknown]
Unfortunately, 97, that is a little fast for a warning.

[00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.812] [Unknown]
OK. That is 27 miles an hour with the post and speed limit.

[00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:25.815] [Unknown]
So you are going to see the citation pledge speed.

[00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:28.558] [Unknown]
I'll explain how you can take care of it when I come back up to the vehicle if you will.

[00:02:28.578 --> 00:02:29.740] [Unknown]
Do you guys just stay in the vehicle?

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.761] [Unknown]
We'll get you out of here shortly.

[00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:31.121] [Unknown]
OK.

Thank you.

[00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:44.785] [Unknown]
and give it this license back.

[00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.659] [Unknown]
Sure, this is an citation I was talking about.

[00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.440] [Unknown]
On the top, there's a court date listed.

[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.102] [Unknown]
You do not have to show up unless you want to.

[00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.444] [Unknown]
Okay, it's going to be the 28th of this month.

[00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:57.149] [Unknown]
Okay, if you don't show up at the date and time listed up top here, that is the date and time that you have to take care of as well.

[00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:57.409] [Unknown]
Okay.

[00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.272] [Unknown]
All the information to do that is on the back, their website, the mailing address as well as their file number.

[00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:03.715] [Unknown]
You can go online to the website here and pay the citation.

[00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.157] [Unknown]
It'll also tell you how much it is when you go on their website.

[00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:07.899] [Unknown]
Okay, it's not listed on your citation.

[00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:14.485] [Unknown]
If you have any trouble doing that, feel free to give them a call at the number listed here during normal business hours and they can point you in the right direction.

[00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:21.093] [Unknown]
So you can't do it today because I was probably going to be at least first of the week maybe Monday afternoon.

[00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:29.808] [Unknown]
I'll upload it before the end of my shift today and ask to go to the court, but I'm pretty sure that they have to show up, download it from the server, and then it will be online.

[00:03:29.828 --> 00:03:34.195] [Unknown]
So give it at least until Monday afternoon and it should be able to pay it then.

[00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:35.117] [Unknown]
Any other questions?

[00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:37.140] [Unknown]
Please be careful pulling out for me.

[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.506] [Unknown]
Definitely drive safe and you guys have a safe trip.

[00:03:40.722 --> 00:03:46.098] [Unknown]
So there are points assessed, there are two points assessed by the state of Ohio.

[00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:51.313] [Unknown]
Since you do have a Texas drivers license, whether it gets transferred to Texas or not, I'm not positive about that.

[00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:54.242] [Unknown]
That'd be something you would have to call Texas as BNV.

[00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:56.744] [Unknown]
And if, you know, I know you said you just moved here.

[00:03:56.764 --> 00:04:00.790] [Unknown]
So if you, if you end up getting a Ohio license, I don't know if it would then transfer.

[00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.370] [Unknown]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.515] [Unknown]
If it goes to your Texas and then you get a Ohio, I don't know if it'll transfer either.

[00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:10.824] [Unknown]
That would be a question for the BMV because they're the ones that they assess the fines, not the court listed on the citation.

[00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:11.284] [Unknown]
All right.

[00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:12.046] [Unknown]
Any other questions?

[00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:12.987] [Unknown]
All right.

[00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:13.988] [Unknown]
Like I said, please be careful.

[00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:14.789] [Unknown]
Now definitely slow down.

[00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:15.571] [Unknown]
You guys have a safe trip.

[00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:16.652] [Unknown]
Have a good one.
